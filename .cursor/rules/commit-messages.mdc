# Commit Message Format

All commit messages must follow the semantic-release Angular preset format to ensure proper versioning and changelog generation.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Commit Types

Use one of these types (as configured in `.releaserc.json`):

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi colons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without bug fixes or features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies

## Examples

```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Simple feature
feat: add user authentication

# ✅ GOOD - Feature with scope
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support

# ✅ GOOD - Bug fix with scope
fix(api): resolve timeout issue in request handler

# ✅ GOOD - Breaking change (use ! after type)
feat!: change API response format

# ✅ GOOD - With body and footer
feat(parser): add support for JSON schema validation

Add comprehensive validation using ajv library.
This ensures all parsed JSON conforms to the expected schema.

BREAKING CHANGE: Invalid JSON schemas will now throw errors instead of warnings.

# ❌ BAD - Missing type
Add new feature

# ❌ BAD - Wrong type
update: change button color

# ❌ BAD - No colon after type
feat add authentication

# ❌ BAD - Type not in allowed list
feature: add new endpoint
```

## Rules

1. **Type is required** and must be one of the allowed types
2. **Scope is optional** but recommended for clarity
3. **Subject is required** and should be lowercase, imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
4. **Body is optional** but recommended for complex changes
5. **Footer is optional** - use for breaking changes or issue references
6. **Breaking changes** should include `!` after the type and `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer

## Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, use `!` after the type:

```bash
feat!: remove deprecated API endpoint
```

Or include in the footer:

```bash
feat(api): update response structure

BREAKING CHANGE: Response now returns data in nested object instead of flat structure
```
